  <h2>Super Nerds Need Super Jobs</h2>
  <p>
    Stand out from the crowd? Ready to be rewarded for your exemplary intellect, experience and drive? Nerd Up works closely with bar-none
    overachievers who want to find a whole different kind of job experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    We aim to steer you away from offices replete with Dilbert dynamics; the din of offices reminiscent of the Bat cave; and the boredom of teams
    without humor, creativity, or passion to push the envelope.
  </p>
  <p>
    We go the extra mile to hitch you up with employers and offices where we ourselves would enjoy spending our days. We also take the time (and
    genuinely care) to understand what would make you love your next job, day to day and long-term. Then, and only then, we go out there and find it
    for or present it to you.
