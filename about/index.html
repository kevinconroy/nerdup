  <h2>Our Story</h2>

  <p>
    We specialize in helping top-level pros find career homes they love. We attract the best and the brightest because we are true matchmakers: we
    listen closely to the ideals of all parties involved and facilitate introductions when - and only when - a match seems destined to be a superior,
    long-term partnership for all involved.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since January 2000, Nerd Up has been providing our expertise in human resource management, position identification, development and recruitment,
    compensation analysis, offer negotiation, and staff retention. And making professionals laugh and smile on both sides of the table, throughout the
    process. Matchmaking, career or otherwise, is about people, a fact too often lost on the monster.com's and by resume readers in search of buzz
    words. We see our role as helping <a href="/nerds/">candidates</a> and <a href="/employers/">employers</a> home in and highlight what's most
    important to themselves and each other; at the end of that process, we hope, the match is based on the essential criteria for both... that's the
    magic that enables the <a href="/jobs/">"dream job"</a> to become a reality, and the <a href="/nerds/">"dream candidate"</a> to join the team.

  <h2>Silly Name?</h2>
  <p>
    We don't think so... Alright, so it is a little silly, we'll give you that. But we're seriously focused on making you - our Number One Priority -
    ecstatic about our services. Our track record proves that the search process pursued with clarity, tenacity and integrity can be both a great
    success AND great fun at the same time.
  </p>
  Our <a href="/nerds/">nerds</a> and <a href="/employers/">employers</a> put fun stuff to work for them while achieving greatness.
