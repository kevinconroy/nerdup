  <h2>Are you a corporate Cahoona, Big Cheese or senior level manager who loves innovating?</h2>

  <p>
    Our executive searches tend to be a little different than others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many companies seek bean counters. Or big egos.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our searches typically involve start up companies in search of senior managers who enjoy rolling up their sleeves and getting their fingernails
    dirty.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're strictly seeking 9-5 and very formal white collar working arenas, we may not have what you want. In fact, we're sure we don't.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our positions span a variety of industry and functional specializations, with base salaries well over $100,000, but the roles are often broad; and
    they require myriad abilities and interests, and a true panache dealing with dynamic scenarios, disparate teams, and multifunctional abilities.
