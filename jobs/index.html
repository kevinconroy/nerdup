<h2>Which one is your dream job?</h2>
<p>
  This isn't just a list of jobs. It's list of positions for the best-of-the-best. These are jobs that will rock the socks off of a <a
    href="/nerds/">Superhero Nerd</a>. These are the kinds of jobs you want to get out of the bed in the morning for. If you think you've
  got what it takes,
  <script type="text/javascript">makeAddressWithLabel("egbert", "nerdup.com", "send us a pigeon");</script>.
</p>
<p>
  Please note though, if you're not funny and extremely driven, or if you've got an ego the size of Milwaukee, or if you don't mind thumb
  twiddling away your days, then <a href="/employers/">our employers</a> and jobs probably aren't for you.
